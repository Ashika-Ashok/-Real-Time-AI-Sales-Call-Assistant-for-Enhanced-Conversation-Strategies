1. What are real-world applications for generative AI?
Creating realistic pictures, films, and sounds, generating text, developing goods, and helping in developing medicines and scientific research are just a few examples of real-world uses for generative AI.

2. What industries can benefit from generative AI tools?
Generative AI Tools can be useful in a variety of industries, including advertising, entertainment, design, manufacturing, healthcare, and finance.

3. Should your company use generative AI tools?
Depending on your particular requirements and available resources, your organization may or may not employ generative AI technologies. Before selecting a choice, take into account the possible advantages, profitability, and ethical implications.

4. Which is the best generative AI tool?
The best generative AI tool may vary depending on the requirements and use cases at hand. The most popular generative AI tools include ChatGPT, GPT-4 by OpenAI, AlphaCode by DeepMind, etc.

5. What is an example of generative AI?
A famous example of generative AI includes ChatGPT. OpenAI's ChatGPT is an AI language model. It converses with people, deciphers text inputs, and generates human-like responses, allowing for interactive and dynamic user interactions.






lesson 12
1. Is ChatGPT better than BERT?
ChatGPT and BERT have different strengths. ChatGPT is great at creating content that drives conversations and generating business-related text, while BERT shines in understanding context in language. Which one you choose really depends on what you need to do.


2. What is BERT vs BART vs GPT?
BERT, BART, and GPT each have their own special features. BERT is all about understanding the context of words in sentences. BART combines understanding and generating text. GPT focuses mainly on creating text. Each one is built for different tasks.


3. What is BERT best for?
BERT is best for jobs that require a solid grasp of language, such as figuring out sentiments in text, answering questions, and recognizing names or places. Its unique way of looking at text helps it understand the meaning behind words, which is useful in many situations.


4. How to use BERT like ChatGPT?
To make BERT work like ChatGPT, you can train it on conversations to adjust it for chat-like tasks. While BERT is primarily made for understanding, fine-tuning it for dialogue can make it work better in conversational settings.


5. Is BERT generative AI?
BERT isn’t classified as generative AI. It’s more about understanding and analyzing text than creating it. Unlike models that produce text from prompts, BERT excels at tasks like classification and comprehension, making it a handy tool for various language tasks.
